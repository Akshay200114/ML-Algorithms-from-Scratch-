# ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch-

I have written some of the Machine learning algorithms of Supervised and Unsupervised both from scratch.

## Pre-Processing ALgorithms.
1. K-Fold Cross validation
2. Grid Search CV
3. Train Test Split.


## Supervised Algorithms

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbours
4. Support Vector machine with sklearn Model Integrated with Scratch 'OVO' and 'OVR'.
5. OVO--> 'One vs One' and OVR --> 'One vs Rest'

## Un-Supervised Algorithms

1. K-means CLustering


## Upcoming Algorithms

1. Some Dimensionality Reduction algorithm like PCA.
